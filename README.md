# Blob-game

Blob-game made using Pygame in python.

The code is part of the python tutorial series by Sentdex on Youtube, text base version of which is available on his [website](https://pythonprogramming.net)

This _non playable game_ was created to learn, understand and implement the concepts of **Object Oriented Programming** and other intermediate concepts in python.

List of concepts covered in the Blob-game mini-project:
1. Pygame
2. Class and objects
3. Modularity
4. Inheritance
5. Operator Overloading
6. Special methods and iterators
7. Logging and headless error handeling
8. `__str__` and `__repr__` methods

This is not a playable game but can be of use to someone who wants to read and understand the code (added comments) to get better idea of above mentioned python and OOPs concepts. 

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository in the local system and run the file named blob_game.py from the terminal to see the game working. 

### Prerequisites

Pygame needs to be installed to use the above code.
```
